# Text-to-Image Generation Using Stable Diffusion

# Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a Text-to-Image Generation Application using Stable Diffusion, a state-of-the-art generative model. The application takes a textual description as input and generates high-quality corresponding images.

It leverages the Stable Diffusion pipeline from Hugging Face's diffusers library, with an optional interactive interface built using Gradio.

# Features
Generate realistic images from text descriptions.
Easy-to-use web interface with live image generation.
Supports customization of key parameters like guidance scale and inference steps.
GPU support for faster generation (if available).

# Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Stable Diffusion: Model for text-to-image generation.
PyTorch: Framework for deep learning and GPU acceleration.
Hugging Face Diffusers: Simplified integration with the Stable Diffusion pipeline.
Gradio: For building an interactive web-based UI.

# Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher.
A machine with a GPU (optional but recommended for faster image generation).

# Usage
Run the Application
You can run the application in two ways:

1. Command Line
2. Interactive Web Interface

# Configuration
Key parameters for the pipeline:

prompt: The text input for image generation.
num_inference_steps: Number of denoising steps (higher = better quality).
guidance_scale: Strength of adherence to the input text (higher = more literal).

# Example
Hereâ€™s an example of generating an image:

Enter the text description:
"A futuristic cityscape at night with glowing neon lights."

Output image:


# Dependencies
